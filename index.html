					Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene <br>
					I'm begging of you please don't take my man <br>
					Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene <br>
					Please don't take him just because you can
				</p>
				<p>
					Your beauty is beyond compare <br>
					With flaming locks of auburn hair <br>
					With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green <br>
					Your smile is like a breath of spring <br>
					Your voice is soft like summer rain <br>
					And I cannot compete with you <br>
					Jolene
				</p>
				<p>
					He talks about you in his sleep <br>
					And there's nothing I can do to keep <br>
					From crying when he calls your name <br>
					Jolene
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="lyrics-second">
				<p>
					And I can easily understand <br>
					How you could easily take my man <br>
					But you don't know what he means to me <br>
					Jolene
				</p>
				<p>
					Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene <br>
					I'm begging of you please don't take my man <br>
					Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene <br>
					Please don't take him just because you can <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					You could have your choice of men <br>
					But I could never love again <br>
					He's the only one for me <br>
					Jolene
				</p>

			<div class="lyrics-third">
				<p>
					I had to have this talk with you <br>
					My happiness depends on you <br>
					And whatever you decide to do <br>
					Jolene <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene <br>
					I'm begging of you please don't take my man <br>
					Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene <br>
					Please don't take him even though you can <br>
					Jolene, Jolene
